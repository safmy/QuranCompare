# Authentication & Subscription Fix Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the fixes implemented to resolve:
1. Perpetual login loop issue
2. Email case sensitivity causing duplicate users
3. Missing user profile UI
4. Subscription status not being recognized

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Email Normalization
All emails are now normalized to lowercase throughout the system:
- Backend: `payment_endpoints.py` - emails converted to lowercase in all endpoints
- Frontend: `supabase.js` & `AuthContext.js` - emails normalized before API calls
- This prevents case-sensitive duplicates (e.g., "User@email.com" vs "user@email.com")

### 2. User Profile Component
Added `UserProfile.jsx` component that displays:
- Current user email
- Subscription status (Premium/Free)
- Subscription expiry date
- Quick actions: Manage Subscription, Sign Out
- Located in top-right corner next to language switcher

### 3. Authentication State Improvements
- Fixed authentication state persistence in `AuthContext.js`
- Added delay before showing auth modal to prevent flash
- Improved subscription checking on login
- Better handling of localStorage fallback

### 4. Duplicate User Cleanup
Created `cleanup_and_fix_users.py` script that:
- Identifies duplicate users (case-insensitive)
- Keeps the newest entry, deletes older duplicates
- Updates premium users with correct subscription status
- Normalizes all emails to lowercase

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Backend Changes
```bash
cd QuranCompare/api
git add payment_endpoints.py
git commit -m "Fix email case sensitivity and improve subscription checking"
git push
```

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend Changes
```bash
cd QuranCompare
npm run build
# Deploy to Netlify
```

### Step 3: Clean Database (IMPORTANT)
You need the **SERVICE KEY** (not anon key) to modify the database.

1. Get your service key from Supabase:
   - Go to: Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API
   - Copy the `service_role` key (NOT the `anon` key)

2. Run the cleanup script:
```bash
cd QuranCompare/api
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="your-service-key-here"
python cleanup_and_fix_users.py
```

3. Follow the prompts to:
   - Review duplicate users
   - Delete duplicates (keeping newest)
   - Update premium users

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing login loop?
1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify Supabase auth is configured correctly

### User still seeing subscription modal?
1. Run the cleanup script to fix their subscription
2. Check if their email has correct case
3. Verify subscription expiry date is in the future

### Can't delete duplicate users?
1. Make sure you're using the SERVICE key, not anon key
2. Service key has full database access
3. Anon key is read-only and won't work
