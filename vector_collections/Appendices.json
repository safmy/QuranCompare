Simple to Understand\nImpossible to Imitate\nFor the first time in history we have a scripture with built-in proof of divine\nauthorship—a superhuman mathematical composition. Any reader of this book can easily verify the Quran’s mathematical miracle. The word “God” (Allah) is written in bold capital letters throughout the text. The cumulative frequency of occurrence of the word “God” is noted at the bot-\ntom of each page in the left hand corner. The number in the right hand corner is\nthe cumulative total of the numbers for verses containing the word “God. ” The\nlast page of the text, Page 372, shows that the total occurrence of the word\n“God” is 2698, or 19x142. The total sum of verse numbers for all verses contain-\ning the word “God” is 118123, also a multiple of 19 (118123 = 19x6217).",

This is especially impossible in view of (1) the age of ignorance during which the\nQuran was revealed, and (2) the fact that the suras and verses were widely\nseparated in time and place of revelation.

[39:45]\nYusuf Ali omitted the crucial word “ALONE” from his translation, and al-\ntered the rest of the verse by inserting the word “(gods). ” Thus, he utterly\ndestroyed this most important Quranic criterion. He translated 39:45 as follows:\nWhen God, the One and Only, is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe\nnot in the Hereafter are filled with disgust and horror; but when (gods)\nother than He are mentioned, behold, they are filled with joy.

Thus,\nYusuf Ali could not bring himself to present the truth of the Quran, if it exposed\nhis corrupted belief. Marmaduke Pickthall translated “ALONE” correctly, but destroyed the\ncriterion by inserting his personal belief in parentheses; he translated 39:45 as\nfollows:\nAnd when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe not in\nthe Hereafter are repelled, and when those (whom they worship) beside Him\nare mentioned, behold! they are glad.

The total count of this letter in the N-initialed sura is\n133, 19x7. The fact that “N” is the last Quranic Initial (see Table 1) brings out a number\nof special observations. For example, the number of verses from the first Quranic\nInitial (A. L. M. of 2:1) to the last initial (N. of 68:1) is 5263, or 19x277. The word “God” (Allah) occurs 2641 (19x139) times between the first initial\nand the last initial. Since the total occurrence of the word “God” is 2698, it\nfollows that its occurrence outside the initials “A. L.

As noted above, the unveiling of the Miracle took place in January 1974. The correlation between 19x74 lunar years and 1974 solar years could not escape\nnotice. This is especially uncanny in view of the fact that “19” is mentioned in\nSura 74. Y. S. (Ya Seen)\nThese two letters prefix Sura 36.

The subtle form of the letter may be confusing\nto those who are not thoroughly familiar with the Arabic language. A good ex-\nample is the word “Araany ” which is mentioned twice in 12:36. The\nletter “Y” is used twice in this word, the first “Y” is subtle and the second is\nobvious. Sura 36 does not contain a single “Y” of the subtle type.

His mis-\nsion is to purify and unify all existing religions into one: Islam (Submis-\nsion). Islam is NOT a name; it is a description of one’s total submission and\ndevotion to God ALONE, without idolizing Jesus, Mary, Muhammad, or\nthe saints. Anyone who meets this criterion is a “Muslim” (Submitter). Therefore, one may be a Muslim Jew, a Muslim Christian, a Muslim\nHindu, a Muslim Buddhist, or Muslim Muslim. God’s Messenger of the Covenant delivers God’s proclamation that “The\nonly religion approved by God is Submission” (3:19) and that “Anyone\nwho seeks other than Submission as a religion, it will not be accepted\nfrom him/her” (3:85). A messenger of God must present proof that he is God’s messenger. Every\nmessenger of God is supported by incontrovertible divine signs proving\nthat he is authorized by the Almighty to deliver His messages.",

Thus, “Nabi” is a messenger of God who\ndelivers a new scripture, while “Rasoul” is a messenger commissioned by God to\nconfirm existing scripture; he does not bring a new scripture. According to the\nQuran, every “Nabi” is a “Rasoul” but not every “Rasoul” is a “Nabi”\nNot every messenger was given a new scripture.

One may be able to meet the numerical distribution requirements of a simple\nmathematical pattern. However, this is invariably accomplished at the expense of\nthe literary quality. The simultaneous control of the literary style and the intri-\ncate mathematical distribution of individual letters throughout the Quran (Ap-\npendix 1) is evident in the fact that the Quran is made easy to memorize, under-\nstand, and enjoy. Unlike a human-made book, the Quran is enjoyable to read\nover and over, infinitely. The title of this Appendix is repeated in Sura 54, verses 17, 22, 32, and 40.

God\ncreated us and He knows the most efficient way for fixing literary materials into\nour memory. Memorization of the Quran has played a vital role in preserving the\noriginal text generation after generation at a time when written books were a\nrarity. Without even realizing it, the person who memorizes the Quran is divinely\nhelped by an intricate literary system as he utters the sounds of the Quranic\nwords. Almost every verse in the Quran contains what I call “Memory Bells. ”\nTheir function is to remind the reader of what comes next.

If this were a\nregular book, one would easily mis-match these six names. Not so in the Quran. Each one of these pairs is preceded in the same verse by a “Memory Bell” that\nreminds us of the correct pair of names. Thus, Verse 127 talks about Abraham\nand Ismail raising the foundations of the Ka‘abah. The verse ends with the\nnames “Al-Samee‘ Al-‘Aleem. ” The prominent sounds here are the “S,” “M,” and\n“ ‘Ayn. ” These three letters are prominent in the word “Ismail. ” We find that this\nword is conspicuously delayed in the sentence, while improving its literary\nquality.",

Another proof of divine preservation of the Islamic practices given to\nAbraham is the “Universal Acceptance” of such practices. There is no dispute\nconcerning the number of Rak‘ahs in all five daily prayers. This proves the divine\npreservation of Salat. The Quran’s mathematical code confirms the number of\nRak‘ahs in the five prayers 2, 4, 4, 3, and 4, respectively. The number 24434 is a\nmultiple of 19.

Hence the use of the plural form in 15:9: “We revealed this\nscripture, and we will preserve it. ” The plural form here simply reflects the fact\nthat the angel Gabriel and the prophet Muhammad participated in the process\nof delivering the Quran. Another example has to do with blowing the breath of life into Adam and\nJesus. The creation of Adam took place in heaven and God directly blew into\nhim the breath of life.

Due to a general unawareness of the fact that Abraham was the original\nmessenger of Islam, many so-called Muslims challenge God: “If the Quran is\ncomplete and fully detailed (as claimed by God), where can we find the number\nof Rak‘ahs (units) in each contact prayer (Salat)?” We learn from the Quran that\nall religious practices of Islam (Submission) were already established before the\nQuran’s revelation (8:35, 9:54, 16:123, 21:73, 22:27, 28:27). Verse 16:123 is direct\nproof that all religious practices in Islam were intact when Muhammad was\nborn. Muhammad was enjoined to “follow the religion of Abraham. ” If I ask you\nto buy a color TV, it is assumed that you know what a color TV is.

Similarly,\nwhen God enjoined Muhammad to follow the practices of Abraham (16:123),\nsuch practices must have been well known. Another proof of divine preservation of the Islamic practices given to\nAbraham is the “Universal Acceptance” of such practices. There is no dispute\nconcerning the number of Rak‘ahs in all five daily prayers. This proves the divine\npreservation of Salat. The Quran’s mathematical code confirms the number of\nRak‘ahs in the five prayers 2, 4, 4, 3, and 4, respectively. The number 24434 is a\nmultiple of 19. The Quran deals only with practices that were distorted. For example, the\ndistorted ablution is restored in 5:6 to its original four steps. The tone of voice\nduring the contact prayers (Salat) was distorted—many Muslims pray silently. This was corrected in the Quran, 17:110. The fasting during Ramadan was\nmodified in the Quran to allow intercourse during the night (2:187).",

The over-\nwhelming message of the Quran, where there is absolutely no compromise is that\n“GOD IS ONE” (2:133, 163; 4:171; 5:73; 6:19; 9:31; 12:39; 13:16; 14:48, 52;\n16:22, 51; 18:110; 21:108; 22:34; 37:4; 38:65; 39:4; 40:16; 41:6; 112:1). Whenever the first person plural form is used by the Almighty, it invariably\nindicates participation of other entities, such as the angels. For example, the\nrevelation of this Quran involved participation of the angel Gabriel and the\nprophet Muhammad.",

For example, the\nrevelation of this Quran involved participation of the angel Gabriel and the\nprophet Muhammad. Hence the use of the plural form in 15:9: “We revealed this\nscripture, and we will preserve it. ” The plural form here simply reflects the fact\nthat the angel Gabriel and the prophet Muhammad participated in the process\nof delivering the Quran. Another example has to do with blowing the breath of life into Adam and\nJesus. The creation of Adam took place in heaven and God directly blew into\nhim the breath of life. Thus, the first person singular form is consistently used: “I\n\nAppendix 10 & Appendix 11 425\nblew into Adam from My spirit” (15:29, 38:72).

Satan believed that his God-given powers qualified him\nto function as an independent god. As evidenced by the prevalence of misery,\ndisease, accidents, and war in his dominion, we now know that Satan is incom-\npetent. The Quran clearly states that Satan was an angel, by virtue of the immense\npowers and rank bestowed upon him. This is why he is addressed as an angel\n(2:34, 7:11, 15:29, 17:61,18:50, 20:116, 38:71) prior to his fall. By definition, a jinn\nis a fallen angel (18:50).

[64] The number of verses in Sura 9, 127, is an odd number. The falsifiers\nadded two fake verses, and this made the number of verses 129, which is also an\nodd number. Mr. Arik used the same computer program he devised for Item 62\nabove to check all odd-numbered verses in the Quran. Thus, the number of ver-\nses in every sura was written down, followed only by the last digit of each of the\nodd-numbered verses in that sura. Sura 1 was represented by the number 71357.

The number of every verse in each of the 85\nsuras was written down, without the number of verses in the sura. Thus, Sura 1\nwas represented by the number 1234567, not 71234567.

[ 72:27 ]\nAmong the duties charged to me as God’s Messenger of the Covenant is\nunveiling the end of the world (Page 415). We learn from 18:7-8 and 69:13-15\nthat this world will come to an end. A new earth and new heavens will replace\nthe present heavens and earth (14:48). Signs of the Approaching End of the World\nThe Quran provides many signs, and states that the means for unveiling the\nend of the world have been given (47:18). The signs given in the Quran include:\n1. The splitting of the moon: This already happened in June 1969 when we\nlanded on the moon and brought back moon rocks. People on earth can go\nnow to many museums, colleges and observatories to look at pieces of the\nmoon. 2. Discovering the Quran’s 19-based mathematical code (74:30-37): Fulfilled\nin 1969-1974. 3.",

Thus, although\npolygamy is permitted by God, it behooves us to examine our circumstances\ncarefully before saying that a particular polygamous relationship is permissible. Our perfect example here is the prophet Muhammad. He was married to one\nwife, Khadijah, until she died. He had all his children, except one, from Khadi-\njah. Thus, she and her children enjoyed the Prophet’s full attention for as long as\nshe was married to him; twenty-five years.",

Thus, she and her children enjoyed the Prophet’s full attention for as long as\nshe was married to him; twenty-five years. For all practical purposes, Muham-\nmad had one wife—from the age of 25 to 50. During the remaining 13 years of\nhis life, he married the aged widows of his friends who left many children. The\nchildren needed a complete home, with a fatherly figure, and the Prophet\nprovided that. Providing a fatherly figure for orphans is the only specific cir-\ncumstance in support of polygamy mentioned in the Quran (4:3). Other than marrying widowed mothers of orphans, there were three political\nmarriages in the Prophet’s life. His close friends Abu Bakr and Omar insisted\nthat he marry their daughters, Aisha and Hafsah, to establish traditional family\nties among them. The third marriage was to Maria the Egyptian; she was given\nto him as a political gesture of friendship from the ruler of Egypt.",
