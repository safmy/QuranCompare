Now we recognize them as a major component of the Quran's mathematical miracle (see Appendices 1, 2, 24, and 26). The meaning of A.L.M. is pointed out in Verse 2: \"This scripture is infallible.\" This is incontrovertibly proven by the fact that the frequencies of occurrence of these three initials in this sura are 4502, 3202, and 2195, respectively. The sum of these numbers is 9899, or 19x521. Thus, these most frequent letters of the Arabic language are mathematically placed according to a super-human pattern. These same initials also prefix Suras 3, 29, 30, 31, and 32, and their frequencies of occurrence add up to multiples of 19 in each one of these suras.",

This confirms that the messenger here is Rashad Khalifa. Additionally, the number of verses from 9:33 to 61:9 (3902)+9+33+61+9+the value of \"Rashad Khalifa\" (1230) gives 5244, also a multiple of 19. The gematrical value of 9:33 & 61:9, calculated by adding the values of every letter, is 7858. By adding this number, plus the number of letters in the two verses (120), plus the number of verses from 9:33 to 61:9 (3902), plus the value of \"Rashad Khalifa\" (1230), we get 7858+120+3902+1230 = 13110 = 19x690.
