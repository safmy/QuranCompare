    "content": "May 1985:  , 2 , 3 , 4 Submitters Perspective  AN INVITATION TO ALL MUSLIMS: OBEY GOD AND THE PROPHET (Continued from the February Issue ) The object of worship is God ALONE. The Muslims, however, have been preoccupied with their idolization of the Prophet in much the same way as the Christians’ preoccupation with Jesus. The only difference being that the Muslims are not aware of their idolatry. In the process of exalting and idolizing a dead, powerless, and totally unaware human being (see 39:30 ), the Muslims have disobeyed the Prophet, and forgot the only one who created them, the only one who is eternally in control, the only one who provides for them, the only one who terminates their life, the only one who will resurrect them, the only one who will call them to account, and the only one who will place them in Heaven or Hell. The function of every messenger has been defined in Qur’an as delivering the message LA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH (there is no god except God) (see 21:25). Now, let us put things in perspective. Our Creator informs us that Qur’an is the only utterance by Muhammad to be upheld as THE ONLY SOURCE OF RELIGIOUS TEACHING (Quran 6:19 and 69:38 -47). This is affirmed by the strongest oath in Qur’an: “I swear by everything you see, and everything you do not see . (this certainly covers everything in the universe). This is the utterance of an honorable messenger. It is not the utterance of a poet; rarely do you believe. Nor is it the utterance of a soothsayer, rarely do you take heed. A revelation from the Lord of the universe. And, if he (Muhammad) ever uttered any other religious teachings, we would have punished him severely, and we would have cut the revelation to him. None of you could have protected him against us.” (Qur’an . Now that we see that Qur’an is decreed by God, through the Prophet’s mouth, as THE ONLY RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS UTTERED BY MUHAMMAD , let us examine the Muslims’ daily disobedience of the Prophet. The wise and fortunate Muslim will readily give up his inherited customs and religious ideas in favor of God’s commandments that came out of the Prophet’s mouth . The unfortunate ones, on the other hand, would stubbornly adhere to what they found their parents and scholars doing: “When told, ‘You shall follow these revelations of God,’ they say, ‘No, we only follow what we found our parents doing’” (Quran 31:21 ) “Their inevitable destiny is Hell. That is because they found their parents astray, and they readily followed in their footsteps.” (Quran 37:68 -70) Here is a list of daily transgressions by the average Muslim against God and the Prophet: (1) EXALTING THE PROPHET AGAINST HIS WILL Verse 285 of Sura 2 states: “ The messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and so did the believers. All of them believe in God, His angels, His scriptures, and His messengers, saying, ‘ We make no distinction among His messengers .’ And they say, ‘ We hear and we obey . Forgive us, our Lord, to You is the final destiny .’” It is of course deliberate, and extremely significant that the statement “ WE HEAR AND WE OBEY ” comes immediately after the statement “ WE MAKE NO DISTINCTION AMONG HIS MESSENGERS .” For it is a glaring fact of life in the Muslim World that the Muslims have defiantly declared “ WE HEAR, BUT WE DISOBEY .” It is a fact of life in the Muslim World that the Muslims commit gross distinctions among God’s messengers by exalting Muhammad over and above all the rest. They bestow extravagant attention on the Prophet Muhammad, while neglecting all other messengers of God. Certainly, if Moses were alive today, and he walked the streets of Cairo, Tehran, or Karachi, he will never hear any Muslim declare: “ASH-HADU ALLA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH, WA ASH-HADU ANNA MOSES RASOOLUL-LAH.” The same would be observed by the Prophet Jesus, or Jonah, or Saleh, or Lot, or Solomon, or any other messenger. This blatant disobedience of the commandments that came out of the Prophet Muhammad’s mouth is so deeply engrained that the average Muslim is now literally unable to say “LA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH (there is no god except God) by itself, without adding the name of Muhammad somehow. Moreover, they readily flunk the Qur’anic criterion that distinguishes true Muslims from false Muslims: “When God ALONE is advocated, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink with aversion. But when others are mentioned besides God, they become happy.” (Quran 39:45 ) Submitters Perspective AN INVITATION TO ALL MUSLIMS: OBEY GOD AND THE PROPHET (Continued from the February Issue ) The object of worship is God ALONE. The Muslims, however, have been preoccupied with their idolization of the Prophet in much the same way as the Christians’ preoccupation with Jesus.

The wise and fortunate Muslim will readily give up his inherited customs and religious ideas in favor of God’s commandments that came out of the Prophet’s mouth . The unfortunate ones, on the other hand, would stubbornly adhere to what they found their parents and scholars doing: (Continued from the February Issue ) The object of worship is God ALONE. The Muslims, however, have been preoccupied with their idolization of the Prophet in much the same way as the Christians’ preoccupation with Jesus. The only difference being that the Muslims are not aware of their idolatry. In the process of exalting and idolizing a dead, powerless, and totally unaware human being (see 39:30 ), the Muslims have disobeyed the Prophet, and forgot the only one who created them, the only one who is eternally in control, the only one who provides for them, the only one who terminates their life, the only one who will resurrect them, the only one who will call them to account, and the only one who will place them in Heaven or Hell. The function of every messenger has been defined in Qur’an as delivering the message LA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH (there is no god except God) (see 21:25). Now, let us put things in perspective. Our Creator informs us that Qur’an is the only utterance by Muhammad to be upheld as THE ONLY SOURCE OF RELIGIOUS TEACHING (Quran 6:19 and 69:38 -47). This is affirmed by the strongest oath in Qur’an: “I swear by everything you see, and everything you do not see . (this certainly covers everything in the universe). This is the utterance of an honorable messenger. It is not the utterance of a poet; rarely do you believe. Nor is it the utterance of a soothsayer, rarely do you take heed. A revelation from the Lord of the universe. And, if he (Muhammad) ever uttered any other religious teachings, we would have punished him severely, and we would have cut the revelation to him. None of you could have protected him against us.” (Qur’an . Now that we see that Qur’an is decreed by God, through the Prophet’s mouth, as THE ONLY RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS UTTERED BY MUHAMMAD , let us examine the Muslims’ daily disobedience of the Prophet. The wise and fortunate Muslim will readily give up his inherited customs and religious ideas in favor of God’s commandments that came out of the Prophet’s mouth . The unfortunate ones, on the other hand, would stubbornly adhere to what they found their parents and scholars doing: “When told, ‘You shall follow these revelations of God,’ they say, ‘No, we only follow what we found our parents doing’” (Quran 31:21 ) “Their inevitable destiny is Hell. That is because they found their parents astray, and they readily followed in their footsteps.” (Quran 37:68 -70) Here is a list of daily transgressions by the average Muslim against God and the Prophet: (1) EXALTING THE PROPHET AGAINST HIS WILL Verse 285 of Sura 2 states: “ The messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and so did the believers. All of them believe in God, His angels, His scriptures, and His messengers, saying, ‘ We make no distinction among His messengers .’ And they say, ‘ We hear and we obey . Forgive us, our Lord, to You is the final destiny .’” It is of course deliberate, and extremely significant that the statement “ WE HEAR AND WE OBEY ” comes immediately after the statement “ WE MAKE NO DISTINCTION AMONG HIS MESSENGERS .” For it is a glaring fact of life in the Muslim World that the Muslims have defiantly declared “ WE HEAR, BUT WE DISOBEY .” It is a fact of life in the Muslim World that the Muslims commit gross distinctions among God’s messengers by exalting Muhammad over and above all the rest. They bestow extravagant attention on the Prophet Muhammad, while neglecting all other messengers of God. Certainly, if Moses were alive today, and he walked the streets of Cairo, Tehran, or Karachi, he will never hear any Muslim declare: “ASH-HADU ALLA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH, WA ASH-HADU ANNA MOSES RASOOLUL-LAH.” The same would be observed by the Prophet Jesus, or Jonah, or Saleh, or Lot, or Solomon, or any other messenger. This blatant disobedience of the commandments that came out of the Prophet Muhammad’s mouth is so deeply engrained that the average Muslim is now literally unable to say “LA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH (there is no god except God) by itself, without adding the name of Muhammad somehow. Moreover, they readily flunk the Qur’anic criterion that distinguishes true Muslims from false Muslims: “When God ALONE is advocated, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink with aversion. But when others are mentioned besides God, they become happy.” (Quran 39:45 ) “When told, ‘You shall follow these revelations of God,’ they say, ‘No, we only follow what we found our parents doing’” (Quran 31:21 ) “Their inevitable destiny is Hell. That is because they found their parents astray, and they readily followed in their footsteps.” (Quran 37:68 -70) Here is a list of daily transgressions by the average Muslim against God and the Prophet: (1) EXALTING THE PROPHET AGAINST HIS WILL Verse 285 of Sura 2 states: “ The messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and so did the believers.

    "content": "May 1986:  , 2 , 3 , 4 Masjid Tucson  Monthly Bulletin of United Submitters International Proclaiming the only religion acceptable to God Salat prayer is the most important practice in Islam, because it is our daily worship. This is a continuation of the on-going research into this most vital issue. Since the Arabic word SALAT is rooted in the word SILAT which means connection or contact , the best translation for SALAT is CONTACT PRAYER . This should differentiate our most important practice from the commoners statement: “I pray all day!” The statement by non-Muslims that they pray all day resulted from the erroneous translation of SALAT into “prayer.” The Muslim who prays should say, “I make contact with my Creator five times each day,” instead of saying, “I pray five times a day.” The main objective of this article is to present further evidence that AL FATIHAH is all that is required during the standing position of the contact prayers . We must read Qur’an everyday, especially at dawn (17:78), but not during the contact prayers . Not only AL FATIHAH alone is required, but also the addition of anything else during the standing position destroys the contact between you and God . As stated in Qur’an 2:37, God gave Adam specific words whereby Adam was redeemed. Similarly, God has given us specific words, namely, AL FATIHAH to utter during SALAT . You can think of AL FATIHAH as a telephone number. If you wish to call someone, you must dial the specific numbers of that person’s telephone. You cannot establish contact unless you dial those specific numbers. When contacting your Creator, you must utter the specific number of letters and sounds that God Himself has given us. To illustrate the error in uttering other Quranic verses after AL FATIHAH , imagine yourself doing the contact prayer. You stand up facing the Qiblah , then you open the contact by raising up your hands as you say Allahu Akbar . Then you recite AL FATIHAH saying, “In the name of God, the most gracious, most merciful. Praise be to God, Lord of the universes. The most gracious, most merciful.” They you speak to God, saying, “Only You we worship; only You we ask for help.” And you continue to speak to God, saying, “Guide us in the right path. The path of those whom You blessed; not of those who incur wrath, nor the strayers.” This should be the end of it in the standing position. But we used to utter additional Qur’an. This additional Qur’an is recognized by all imams of jurisprudence (Sunni and/or Shia) as non-obligatory. Now look carefully at what we used to say to God after AL FATIHA . We used to say things like, “INNAA A’ATAYNAKAL KAWTHAR”, which means “We have given you many bounties.”!!! Here, we tell God, as we speak to Him, “We have given You many bounties!!!” Does this make sense? We never even thought about it. We were so wrapped up in the innovations inherited from our parents, that we didn’t think about the things we were telling our Creator. We used to say things like, “QUL HUWAL LAAHU AHAD” which mean, “Say, ‘God is One.’” Here we are ordering God to state that God is one!!! We used to utter things, after AL FATIHAH like, “ QUL A’UZU BI RABBIL FALAQ. ” Here we were telling God to seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak!!! Thank God for leading us out of the darkness of innovatior into the light of truth; we now see the mistakes we inherited from our parents. WHO ARE WE?

    "content": "May 1986:  , 2 , 3 , 4 Submitters Perspective  MUSLIM âULAMA CHALLENGE GOD PRODUCE SOMETHING âEQUALâ TO QURâAN By Mohammed Kamaludin, Singapore RABITAT ALâALAM AL ISLAMI , the official Arabic magazine of the Muslim World League, in its 1983 March issue carried an article titled TADWEEN AL SUNNAH by Ustad Muhammad Nizami. He quotes SUNAN ABI DAWOOD that the prophet had declared that, âKnow that Qurâan and the LIKE of it (âmithluhuâ i.e. Sunnah ) was given to me.â Mr. Nizami also states the reasons for âequality (mumathalah) of sunnah with Qurâan. â This simply amounts to the DECLARATION THAT SUNNAH IS SIMILAR TO QURâAN . Since the written record of Sunnah is Hadith , then Hadith is LIKE Qurâan ! The similarity of the two is further reinforced by the â facts â (as claimed by the author). He states that Sunnah/Hadith is inspired in idea form, is used in prayers and preaching, and is âguidance for mankind.â He also states that the compilers of Hadith were really âtruthfulâ scholars, and that all of them are imams! But God has challenged the world in Qurâan: âLet them produce a Hadith LIKE IT (MITHLIHI) â i.e. like Qurâan), if they are truthful.â (52:34) History records that from the time of Rasulullah to this day the unbelieving section of humanity has never produced any hadith or book which the Muslims could use LIKE QURâAN . But here we see an outstanding Muslim âAlim, representing âulamadomâ of Islam DECLARING IN AN OFFICIAL ORGAN OF THE âULAMA THAT THEY HAVE PRODUCED SOMETHING LIKE QURâAN; THAT THEY HAVE THE SUNNAH/HADITH WHICH IS LIKE QURâAN! IS THIS NOT THE SAME AS CHALLENGING GOD BACK? IS THIS NOT EQUAL TO ADMITTING THE ACCEPTANCE OF GODâS CHALLENGE TO PRODUCE SOMETHING SIMILAR OR EQUAL TO QURâAN? IS THIS NOT A WORD FOR WORD FULFILLMENT OF GODâS PROPHECY? The legality of Sunnah/Hadith cannot be claimed on the basis of verses 53:3-4: \"He does not speak on his own. This is a divine inspiration.â (3 ) without admitting that the Prophetâs actions that led to the incidents described in 66:1, 80:1-10, 18:23, 24, 33:37, 40:66, and 93:7 were also inspired . And it is not explained at all that having inspired the Prophet to do something, then, when done, why does Allah REPRIMAND him and immortalize those incidents in Qurâan! Ustad Nizami quotes an hadith that âin the beginning the writing of hadith was forbidden (âDo not write anything from me except Qurâan. Those who have written anything other than Qurâan shall erase it.) For the reasons that âhdith might get mixed up with Qurâan and might hinder the memorization of Qurâan.â In fact, this danger of hadith âgetting mixed up with Qurâan existed until the final verse of Qurâan was revealed. (The Prophet died nine days after revelation of the last verse.) Any attempt at writing Hadith during that period, therefore, constitutes clear violation of the Qurâanic commandment. âYou shall obey God, and you shall obey the prophet.â When Abdullah ibn âAmr was âallowed to write hadithâ in AH 7 as he became a Muslim, Rasulullah seems contradicting himself. Also earlier Muslims do not seem to have received this special treatment . The claim that the completion of Qurâan had superceded the earlier instruction is strange; no evidence is produced to the effect that Rasulullah had cancelled it ! Believing that Rasulullah had perfectly understood Qurâan including verses 52:34, 7:185, 77:50, 45:6, 4:87, 39:23, 68:44, 56:81, 12:111, and 31:6 (all against hadith and none of the 36 references on hadith supports it ), it is hard to believe that he had cancelled his instruction NOT TO WRITE HADITH . Again the Prophet was disobeyed by not making unanimous and uncontested selection of KHULAFA UR RASHIDEEN whom the Prophet had supposedly identified and nominated, according to his hadith , âFollow my sunnah and the sunnah of AL KHULAFA AL RASHIDEEN after me.â The selection of the first Khalifa was contested on the very morning Rasulullah had passed away, and this matter remains disastrously divisive until today. On the Day of Judgment, Rasulullah will complain to Allah: âO my Lord; my people had forsaken this Quran.â (25:30) This means that he either ignores or is ignorant of Sunnah/Hadith. Either way, it is clear that he did not approve Sunnah/Hadith until his death or even after. If he had approved, as claimed by Hadith, then why should he shy away from defending it on the Day of Judgment?

Ustad Nizami quotes an hadith that âin the beginning the writing of hadith was forbidden (âDo not write anything from me except Qurâan. Those who have written anything other than Qurâan shall erase it.) For the reasons that âhdith might get mixed up with Qurâan and might hinder the memorization of Qurâan.â In fact, this danger of hadith âgetting mixed up with Qurâan existed until the final verse of Qurâan was revealed. (The Prophet died nine days after revelation of the last verse.) Any attempt at writing Hadith during that period, therefore, constitutes clear violation of the Qurâanic commandment. âYou shall obey God, and you shall obey the prophet.â When Abdullah ibn âAmr was âallowed to write hadithâ in AH 7 as he became a Muslim, Rasulullah seems contradicting himself. Also earlier Muslims do not seem to have received this special treatment . The claim that the completion of Qurâan had superceded the earlier instruction is strange; no evidence is produced to the effect that Rasulullah had cancelled it ! Believing that Rasulullah had perfectly understood Qurâan including verses 52:34, 7:185, 77:50, 45:6, 4:87, 39:23, 68:44, 56:81, 12:111, and 31:6 (all against hadith and none of the 36 references on hadith supports it ), it is hard to believe that he had cancelled his instruction NOT TO WRITE HADITH . Again the Prophet was disobeyed by not making unanimous and uncontested selection of KHULAFA UR RASHIDEEN whom the Prophet had supposedly identified and nominated, according to his hadith , âFollow my sunnah and the sunnah of AL KHULAFA AL RASHIDEEN after me.â The selection of the first Khalifa was contested on the very morning Rasulullah had passed away, and this matter remains disastrously divisive until today. On the Day of Judgment, Rasulullah will complain to Allah: âO my Lord; my people had forsaken this Quran.â (25:30) This means that he either ignores or is ignorant of Sunnah/Hadith. Either way, it is clear that he did not approve Sunnah/Hadith until his death or even after. If he had approved, as claimed by Hadith, then why should he shy away from defending it on the Day of Judgment? Continued on page 3 Rasulullah seems contradicting himself.

Muslim ‘Ulama Challenge God: Produce Something \"Equal\" to Quran Continued from page 3 Yet another ugly aspect is recorded by a âProfessor of Islamic Studiesâ that: âThe Prophet himself referred to this inner aspect of his nature as in the Hadith, âI am Araby without the letter âAyn (that is âRabâ which means Lord). Who hath seen me, has seen God (the truth).â (pg 89, âIDEALS AND REALITIES IN ISLAMâ by Dr. Sayyed Hussein Nasr, George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London, 1966.) This must be acceptable to the âUlama as none of them has ever protested in the last 19 plus years since publication of that book.

At least four times in Qurâan Rasulullah was commanded to follow what was revealed to him from God (6:106, 10:109, 33:2, & 75:18). At least four times he was ordered to say: I only follow what is revealed to me. (6.50, 10:15, 46:9, & 7:203) So he followed Qurâan alone. In fifty plus places Allah emphasizes that He explains His Ayaat. 25:33 says that God provides the best tafseer (explanation) of Qurâan. 75:19 says that God is the only one who will explain Qurâan. The first mufassir (interpreter) of Qurâan was Satan (7:19-21), and he has vowed to misguide us from Godâs straight path (7:16-17).
