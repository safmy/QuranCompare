    "content": "May 1985:  , 2 , 3 , 4 Submitters Perspective  AN INVITATION TO ALL MUSLIMS: OBEY GOD AND THE PROPHET (Continued from the February Issue ) The object of worship is God ALONE. The Muslims, however, have been preoccupied with their idolization of the Prophet in much the same way as the Christians’ preoccupation with Jesus. The only difference being that the Muslims are not aware of their idolatry. In the process of exalting and idolizing a dead, powerless, and totally unaware human being (see 39:30 ), the Muslims have disobeyed the Prophet, and forgot the only one who created them, the only one who is eternally in control, the only one who provides for them, the only one who terminates their life, the only one who will resurrect them, the only one who will call them to account, and the only one who will place them in Heaven or Hell. The function of every messenger has been defined in Qur’an as delivering the message LA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH (there is no god except God) (see 21:25). Now, let us put things in perspective. Our Creator informs us that Qur’an is the only utterance by Muhammad to be upheld as THE ONLY SOURCE OF RELIGIOUS TEACHING (Quran 6:19 and 69:38 -47). This is affirmed by the strongest oath in Qur’an: “I swear by everything you see, and everything you do not see . (this certainly covers everything in the universe). This is the utterance of an honorable messenger. It is not the utterance of a poet; rarely do you believe. Nor is it the utterance of a soothsayer, rarely do you take heed. A revelation from the Lord of the universe. And, if he (Muhammad) ever uttered any other religious teachings, we would have punished him severely, and we would have cut the revelation to him. None of you could have protected him against us.” (Qur’an . Now that we see that Qur’an is decreed by God, through the Prophet’s mouth, as THE ONLY RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS UTTERED BY MUHAMMAD , let us examine the Muslims’ daily disobedience of the Prophet. The wise and fortunate Muslim will readily give up his inherited customs and religious ideas in favor of God’s commandments that came out of the Prophet’s mouth . The unfortunate ones, on the other hand, would stubbornly adhere to what they found their parents and scholars doing: “When told, ‘You shall follow these revelations of God,’ they say, ‘No, we only follow what we found our parents doing’” (Quran 31:21 ) “Their inevitable destiny is Hell. That is because they found their parents astray, and they readily followed in their footsteps.” (Quran 37:68 -70) Here is a list of daily transgressions by the average Muslim against God and the Prophet: (1) EXALTING THE PROPHET AGAINST HIS WILL Verse 285 of Sura 2 states: “ The messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and so did the believers. All of them believe in God, His angels, His scriptures, and His messengers, saying, ‘ We make no distinction among His messengers .’ And they say, ‘ We hear and we obey . Forgive us, our Lord, to You is the final destiny .’” It is of course deliberate, and extremely significant that the statement “ WE HEAR AND WE OBEY ” comes immediately after the statement “ WE MAKE NO DISTINCTION AMONG HIS MESSENGERS .” For it is a glaring fact of life in the Muslim World that the Muslims have defiantly declared “ WE HEAR, BUT WE DISOBEY .” It is a fact of life in the Muslim World that the Muslims commit gross distinctions among God’s messengers by exalting Muhammad over and above all the rest. They bestow extravagant attention on the Prophet Muhammad, while neglecting all other messengers of God. Certainly, if Moses were alive today, and he walked the streets of Cairo, Tehran, or Karachi, he will never hear any Muslim declare: “ASH-HADU ALLA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH, WA ASH-HADU ANNA MOSES RASOOLUL-LAH.” The same would be observed by the Prophet Jesus, or Jonah, or Saleh, or Lot, or Solomon, or any other messenger. This blatant disobedience of the commandments that came out of the Prophet Muhammad’s mouth is so deeply engrained that the average Muslim is now literally unable to say “LA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH (there is no god except God) by itself, without adding the name of Muhammad somehow. Moreover, they readily flunk the Qur’anic criterion that distinguishes true Muslims from false Muslims: “When God ALONE is advocated, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink with aversion. But when others are mentioned besides God, they become happy.” (Quran 39:45 ) Submitters Perspective AN INVITATION TO ALL MUSLIMS: OBEY GOD AND THE PROPHET (Continued from the February Issue ) The object of worship is God ALONE. The Muslims, however, have been preoccupied with their idolization of the Prophet in much the same way as the Christians’ preoccupation with Jesus.

The wise and fortunate Muslim will readily give up his inherited customs and religious ideas in favor of God’s commandments that came out of the Prophet’s mouth . The unfortunate ones, on the other hand, would stubbornly adhere to what they found their parents and scholars doing: (Continued from the February Issue ) The object of worship is God ALONE. The Muslims, however, have been preoccupied with their idolization of the Prophet in much the same way as the Christians’ preoccupation with Jesus. The only difference being that the Muslims are not aware of their idolatry. In the process of exalting and idolizing a dead, powerless, and totally unaware human being (see 39:30 ), the Muslims have disobeyed the Prophet, and forgot the only one who created them, the only one who is eternally in control, the only one who provides for them, the only one who terminates their life, the only one who will resurrect them, the only one who will call them to account, and the only one who will place them in Heaven or Hell. The function of every messenger has been defined in Qur’an as delivering the message LA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH (there is no god except God) (see 21:25). Now, let us put things in perspective. Our Creator informs us that Qur’an is the only utterance by Muhammad to be upheld as THE ONLY SOURCE OF RELIGIOUS TEACHING (Quran 6:19 and 69:38 -47). This is affirmed by the strongest oath in Qur’an: “I swear by everything you see, and everything you do not see . (this certainly covers everything in the universe). This is the utterance of an honorable messenger. It is not the utterance of a poet; rarely do you believe. Nor is it the utterance of a soothsayer, rarely do you take heed. A revelation from the Lord of the universe. And, if he (Muhammad) ever uttered any other religious teachings, we would have punished him severely, and we would have cut the revelation to him. None of you could have protected him against us.” (Qur’an . Now that we see that Qur’an is decreed by God, through the Prophet’s mouth, as THE ONLY RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS UTTERED BY MUHAMMAD , let us examine the Muslims’ daily disobedience of the Prophet. The wise and fortunate Muslim will readily give up his inherited customs and religious ideas in favor of God’s commandments that came out of the Prophet’s mouth . The unfortunate ones, on the other hand, would stubbornly adhere to what they found their parents and scholars doing: “When told, ‘You shall follow these revelations of God,’ they say, ‘No, we only follow what we found our parents doing’” (Quran 31:21 ) “Their inevitable destiny is Hell. That is because they found their parents astray, and they readily followed in their footsteps.” (Quran 37:68 -70) Here is a list of daily transgressions by the average Muslim against God and the Prophet: (1) EXALTING THE PROPHET AGAINST HIS WILL Verse 285 of Sura 2 states: “ The messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and so did the believers. All of them believe in God, His angels, His scriptures, and His messengers, saying, ‘ We make no distinction among His messengers .’ And they say, ‘ We hear and we obey . Forgive us, our Lord, to You is the final destiny .’” It is of course deliberate, and extremely significant that the statement “ WE HEAR AND WE OBEY ” comes immediately after the statement “ WE MAKE NO DISTINCTION AMONG HIS MESSENGERS .” For it is a glaring fact of life in the Muslim World that the Muslims have defiantly declared “ WE HEAR, BUT WE DISOBEY .” It is a fact of life in the Muslim World that the Muslims commit gross distinctions among God’s messengers by exalting Muhammad over and above all the rest. They bestow extravagant attention on the Prophet Muhammad, while neglecting all other messengers of God. Certainly, if Moses were alive today, and he walked the streets of Cairo, Tehran, or Karachi, he will never hear any Muslim declare: “ASH-HADU ALLA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH, WA ASH-HADU ANNA MOSES RASOOLUL-LAH.” The same would be observed by the Prophet Jesus, or Jonah, or Saleh, or Lot, or Solomon, or any other messenger. This blatant disobedience of the commandments that came out of the Prophet Muhammad’s mouth is so deeply engrained that the average Muslim is now literally unable to say “LA ILAHA ILLA ALLAH (there is no god except God) by itself, without adding the name of Muhammad somehow. Moreover, they readily flunk the Qur’anic criterion that distinguishes true Muslims from false Muslims: “When God ALONE is advocated, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink with aversion. But when others are mentioned besides God, they become happy.” (Quran 39:45 ) “When told, ‘You shall follow these revelations of God,’ they say, ‘No, we only follow what we found our parents doing’” (Quran 31:21 ) “Their inevitable destiny is Hell. That is because they found their parents astray, and they readily followed in their footsteps.” (Quran 37:68 -70) Here is a list of daily transgressions by the average Muslim against God and the Prophet: (1) EXALTING THE PROPHET AGAINST HIS WILL Verse 285 of Sura 2 states: “ The messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and so did the believers.

    "content": "May 1986:  , 2 , 3 , 4 Masjid Tucson  Monthly Bulletin of United Submitters International Proclaiming the only religion acceptable to God Salat prayer is the most important practice in Islam, because it is our daily worship. This is a continuation of the on-going research into this most vital issue. Since the Arabic word SALAT is rooted in the word SILAT which means connection or contact , the best translation for SALAT is CONTACT PRAYER . This should differentiate our most important practice from the commoners statement: “I pray all day!” The statement by non-Muslims that they pray all day resulted from the erroneous translation of SALAT into “prayer.” The Muslim who prays should say, “I make contact with my Creator five times each day,” instead of saying, “I pray five times a day.” The main objective of this article is to present further evidence that AL FATIHAH is all that is required during the standing position of the contact prayers . We must read Qur’an everyday, especially at dawn (17:78), but not during the contact prayers . Not only AL FATIHAH alone is required, but also the addition of anything else during the standing position destroys the contact between you and God . As stated in Qur’an 2:37, God gave Adam specific words whereby Adam was redeemed. Similarly, God has given us specific words, namely, AL FATIHAH to utter during SALAT . You can think of AL FATIHAH as a telephone number. If you wish to call someone, you must dial the specific numbers of that person’s telephone. You cannot establish contact unless you dial those specific numbers. When contacting your Creator, you must utter the specific number of letters and sounds that God Himself has given us. To illustrate the error in uttering other Quranic verses after AL FATIHAH , imagine yourself doing the contact prayer. You stand up facing the Qiblah , then you open the contact by raising up your hands as you say Allahu Akbar . Then you recite AL FATIHAH saying, “In the name of God, the most gracious, most merciful. Praise be to God, Lord of the universes. The most gracious, most merciful.” They you speak to God, saying, “Only You we worship; only You we ask for help.” And you continue to speak to God, saying, “Guide us in the right path. The path of those whom You blessed; not of those who incur wrath, nor the strayers.” This should be the end of it in the standing position. But we used to utter additional Qur’an. This additional Qur’an is recognized by all imams of jurisprudence (Sunni and/or Shia) as non-obligatory. Now look carefully at what we used to say to God after AL FATIHA . We used to say things like, “INNAA A’ATAYNAKAL KAWTHAR”, which means “We have given you many bounties.”!!! Here, we tell God, as we speak to Him, “We have given You many bounties!!!” Does this make sense? We never even thought about it. We were so wrapped up in the innovations inherited from our parents, that we didn’t think about the things we were telling our Creator. We used to say things like, “QUL HUWAL LAAHU AHAD” which mean, “Say, ‘God is One.’” Here we are ordering God to state that God is one!!! We used to utter things, after AL FATIHAH like, “ QUL A’UZU BI RABBIL FALAQ. ” Here we were telling God to seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak!!! Thank God for leading us out of the darkness of innovatior into the light of truth; we now see the mistakes we inherited from our parents. WHO ARE WE?

    "content": "May 1986:  , 2 , 3 , 4 Submitters Perspective  MUSLIM âULAMA CHALLENGE GOD PRODUCE SOMETHING âEQUALâ TO QURâAN By Mohammed Kamaludin, Singapore RABITAT ALâALAM AL ISLAMI , the official Arabic magazine of the Muslim World League, in its 1983 March issue carried an article titled TADWEEN AL SUNNAH by Ustad Muhammad Nizami. He quotes SUNAN ABI DAWOOD that the prophet had declared that, âKnow that Qurâan and the LIKE of it (âmithluhuâ i.e. Sunnah ) was given to me.â Mr. Nizami also states the reasons for âequality (mumathalah) of sunnah with Qurâan. â This simply amounts to the DECLARATION THAT SUNNAH IS SIMILAR TO QURâAN . Since the written record of Sunnah is Hadith , then Hadith is LIKE Qurâan ! The similarity of the two is further reinforced by the â facts â (as claimed by the author). He states that Sunnah/Hadith is inspired in idea form, is used in prayers and preaching, and is âguidance for mankind.â He also states that the compilers of Hadith were really âtruthfulâ scholars, and that all of them are imams! But God has challenged the world in Qurâan: âLet them produce a Hadith LIKE IT (MITHLIHI) â i.e. like Qurâan), if they are truthful.â (52:34) History records that from the time of Rasulullah to this day the unbelieving section of humanity has never produced any hadith or book which the Muslims could use LIKE QURâAN . But here we see an outstanding Muslim âAlim, representing âulamadomâ of Islam DECLARING IN AN OFFICIAL ORGAN OF THE âULAMA THAT THEY HAVE PRODUCED SOMETHING LIKE QURâAN; THAT THEY HAVE THE SUNNAH/HADITH WHICH IS LIKE QURâAN! IS THIS NOT THE SAME AS CHALLENGING GOD BACK? IS THIS NOT EQUAL TO ADMITTING THE ACCEPTANCE OF GODâS CHALLENGE TO PRODUCE SOMETHING SIMILAR OR EQUAL TO QURâAN? IS THIS NOT A WORD FOR WORD FULFILLMENT OF GODâS PROPHECY? The legality of Sunnah/Hadith cannot be claimed on the basis of verses 53:3-4: \"He does not speak on his own. This is a divine inspiration.â (3 ) without admitting that the Prophetâs actions that led to the incidents described in 66:1, 80:1-10, 18:23, 24, 33:37, 40:66, and 93:7 were also inspired . And it is not explained at all that having inspired the Prophet to do something, then, when done, why does Allah REPRIMAND him and immortalize those incidents in Qurâan! Ustad Nizami quotes an hadith that âin the beginning the writing of hadith was forbidden (âDo not write anything from me except Qurâan. Those who have written anything other than Qurâan shall erase it.) For the reasons that âhdith might get mixed up with Qurâan and might hinder the memorization of Qurâan.â In fact, this danger of hadith âgetting mixed up with Qurâan existed until the final verse of Qurâan was revealed. (The Prophet died nine days after revelation of the last verse.) Any attempt at writing Hadith during that period, therefore, constitutes clear violation of the Qurâanic commandment. âYou shall obey God, and you shall obey the prophet.â When Abdullah ibn âAmr was âallowed to write hadithâ in AH 7 as he became a Muslim, Rasulullah seems contradicting himself. Also earlier Muslims do not seem to have received this special treatment . The claim that the completion of Qurâan had superceded the earlier instruction is strange; no evidence is produced to the effect that Rasulullah had cancelled it ! Believing that Rasulullah had perfectly understood Qurâan including verses 52:34, 7:185, 77:50, 45:6, 4:87, 39:23, 68:44, 56:81, 12:111, and 31:6 (all against hadith and none of the 36 references on hadith supports it ), it is hard to believe that he had cancelled his instruction NOT TO WRITE HADITH . Again the Prophet was disobeyed by not making unanimous and uncontested selection of KHULAFA UR RASHIDEEN whom the Prophet had supposedly identified and nominated, according to his hadith , âFollow my sunnah and the sunnah of AL KHULAFA AL RASHIDEEN after me.â The selection of the first Khalifa was contested on the very morning Rasulullah had passed away, and this matter remains disastrously divisive until today. On the Day of Judgment, Rasulullah will complain to Allah: âO my Lord; my people had forsaken this Quran.â (25:30) This means that he either ignores or is ignorant of Sunnah/Hadith. Either way, it is clear that he did not approve Sunnah/Hadith until his death or even after. If he had approved, as claimed by Hadith, then why should he shy away from defending it on the Day of Judgment?

Ustad Nizami quotes an hadith that âin the beginning the writing of hadith was forbidden (âDo not write anything from me except Qurâan. Those who have written anything other than Qurâan shall erase it.) For the reasons that âhdith might get mixed up with Qurâan and might hinder the memorization of Qurâan.â In fact, this danger of hadith âgetting mixed up with Qurâan existed until the final verse of Qurâan was revealed. (The Prophet died nine days after revelation of the last verse.) Any attempt at writing Hadith during that period, therefore, constitutes clear violation of the Qurâanic commandment. âYou shall obey God, and you shall obey the prophet.â When Abdullah ibn âAmr was âallowed to write hadithâ in AH 7 as he became a Muslim, Rasulullah seems contradicting himself. Also earlier Muslims do not seem to have received this special treatment . The claim that the completion of Qurâan had superceded the earlier instruction is strange; no evidence is produced to the effect that Rasulullah had cancelled it ! Believing that Rasulullah had perfectly understood Qurâan including verses 52:34, 7:185, 77:50, 45:6, 4:87, 39:23, 68:44, 56:81, 12:111, and 31:6 (all against hadith and none of the 36 references on hadith supports it ), it is hard to believe that he had cancelled his instruction NOT TO WRITE HADITH . Again the Prophet was disobeyed by not making unanimous and uncontested selection of KHULAFA UR RASHIDEEN whom the Prophet had supposedly identified and nominated, according to his hadith , âFollow my sunnah and the sunnah of AL KHULAFA AL RASHIDEEN after me.â The selection of the first Khalifa was contested on the very morning Rasulullah had passed away, and this matter remains disastrously divisive until today. On the Day of Judgment, Rasulullah will complain to Allah: âO my Lord; my people had forsaken this Quran.â (25:30) This means that he either ignores or is ignorant of Sunnah/Hadith. Either way, it is clear that he did not approve Sunnah/Hadith until his death or even after. If he had approved, as claimed by Hadith, then why should he shy away from defending it on the Day of Judgment? Continued on page 3 Rasulullah seems contradicting himself.

This editorial, which represents the general belief of the Muslim masses, clearly reveals two major disasters: (1) that the Muslims generally do not accept LAA ELAAHA ELLA ALLAH (There is no god except Allah) by itself, even though this is the message delivered by Muhammad and all previous messengers (please see 21:25), and (2) they do not have any idea what shirk is. Shirk, by definition, is putting anything besides God, in any way, shape, or form. The Qurâan makes this extremely clear by stating that the mere mention of anything or anyone besides God is Shirk . Please see 39:45 and 40:10-12.

    "title": "The Hadith Debate; Muslim Perspective May 1988",
    "content": "May 1988:  , 2 , 3 , 4 Submitters Perspective  THE HADITH DEBATE Rationalism VS Irrationalism by Kassim Ahmad I have sufficiently shown â¦ that the so-called âauthenticâ Hadith possess the characteristics of being sectarian and factional, anti-science, anti-reason and anti-woman, apart from being anti-Quran. These constitute a perfect prescription for disunity and backwardness. The current Hadith debate in Malaysia and in some other Muslims countries arising from my book published last year (Hadith â A Re-evaluation) reminds me of George Sartonâs remark in his monumental three-volume â A History of Scienceâ. He said, âThe main issue, then as now, was not between materialism and spiritualism, but between rationalism and irrationalism. It is amazing to discover that in that very early time almost all the Greek philosophers had already realized that. No system of theirs, not even the Epicurean, was purely materialistic; none, not even the Platonic, was purely spiritualistic. They all understand that one needs some kind of matter even for thinking, and that one cannot refute spiritualism except with some kind of mind or spirit.â The dominant anti-rationalist current in the present Islamic renaissance movement must sooner or later come to realize, as did their early rationalist ancestors, the profound Quranic truth that faith and reason are not in conflict. They are two sides of the same coin. Many verses stress this. Indeed, God repeatedly says that the Quran is addressed to those who think. And extremely clear verse pointing to the very close relationship between faith and reason reads: âNo soul can believe except with Godâs leave, for He deliberately blocks out those who defy common sense.â (10:100) It was precisely because the early Muslim generations observed the unity of faith and reason that they were able to create monuments of science, thought and culture. Present-day Muslims must retrace their steps back to the spirit of those times to regain the scientific, intellectual and political leadership of the world that they once held. Are they capable of doing it again? If they are not (and the odds are against them), other nations will replace them, as the Quran has warned (see Quran 47:38). I cannot deal with all the points that have been raised in this debate. I have answered some of them in two of my earlier articles (see âSunday Starâ and New Sunday Timesâ, Kuala Lumpur, June 22, 1986). My traditionalist critics, theologians and scholars alike, who have brought out two books to answer mine, have merely repeated the age-old classical arguments for upholding the Hadith, which I have refuted. It is my humble opinion that they have not answered my refutation. I have quoted many clear verses of the Quran and some conforming hadith in my book to prove that the prophet brought, taught, followed and preached with only the Quran. Unfortunately, our modern-day blind followers of traditionalist theologians simply will not give serious consideration to them, seeking to rationalize them to conform to their already-formed opinions, and arguing that the majority of theologians, past and present, cannot make mistakes. Yet they know full well that the truth does not depend on the majority! They tirelessly and unashamedly argue that Godâs command to us to obey the messenger means that we should follow the Hadith when the phrase clearly means to obey God and to follow only the Quran. This meaning is supported by countless other verses in the Quran, by such proven weaknesses of very many âauthenticâ hadith and by such proven weaknesses of the classical Hadith methodology that its is pointless to dwell on it any further. MostÂ of our traditionalist theologians and scholars have proved themselves quite incapable of discussing the Hadith issue rationally and intelligently. This is strongest reason why a public debate is necessary so that the enlightened sections of the Muslim community can criticize their errors as well as their narrow-mindedness and bigotry, and bring them back to reason. Many people criticize me for connecting the Hadith with Muslim disunity and backwardness, some contending that many Muslims have not even read any book of Hadith, let alone being influenced by it. They have missed the point altogether. The relevant question is one of the ideological basis or bases of Muslim behaviour, not what books they read or do not read. As a matter of fact, the Hadith has been with us for around a thousand years and has been actively propagated to us for as long. I agree that not all Muslims have come under the spell of the Hadith, as a number of them have chosen to follow liberalism or Marxism as of late (including me, at one time!). But none of us can deny the fact that the Hadith, alone among other ideological ingredients, has been, since it emergence, the major ideological basis of Muslim thought and behaviour. If one understands this non-Quranic ideological configuration under which modern Muslims live, one can grasp the profound import of the prophetic words of the Quran: Shall We treat the submitters like the guilty? What is wrong with you? How do you judge? Do you have anotherÂ Â Â Â Â book that you apply? One that gives you anything you want? (68:35-38) The messenger will say, âMy Lord, my people have deserted this Quran.â (25:30) Â Â Â Of course, the traditionalist theologians and scholars, tied to their traditional âsacrosanctâ methodology, will hotly deny the applicability of these verses to the Muslims. But since the Quran is current, what can the phrase âanother bookâ that âgives you anything you wantâ mean for the Muslims but the Hadith? As to the second verse, it obviously refers to the present rejection of the Quran by all ideological groups of mankind, including the formal Muslims. The term âmy peopleâ used by Prophet Muhammad must mean âall mankindâ since his mission was universal. In spite of the contradictory testimony of historical sources, a general conclusion may be safely drawn that the first division in the early Muslim community between the âorthodoxâ Sunni party and the âheterodoxâ Shiâah party of Ali was both political and religious. The party of Ali resorted to a so-called Ghadir Khum hadith in which the prophet was alleged to have said, âHe of whom I am master, of him Ali is also the master,â in order to bolster up their factionalism when the noble prophet spent his whole life fighting against it! Of course, at this time the hadith had not yet been compiled or institutionalized as a primary source of law, but the great prestige of the prophet had already been misused by the various political and theological factions. It should be well noted that as long as the Quran remained the only primary source of reference for the Muslims, they could reunite and advance on the basis of its teachings, but as soon as they set up other sources of reference to rival the Quran, as happened when they set up the Hadith as the âsecond primaryâ source, the division became irreversible, continuous and permanent. I have sufficiently shown in my little book that the so-called âauthenticâ Hadith possess the characteristics of being sectarian and factional, anti-science, anti-reason, and Continued on page 3 Submitters Perspective THE HADITH DEBATE Rationalism VS Irrationalism by Kassim Ahmad I have sufficiently shown â¦ that the so-called âauthenticâ Hadith possess the characteristics of being sectarian and factional, anti-science, anti-reason and anti-woman, apart from being anti-Quran.

But none of us can deny the fact that the Hadith, alone among other ideological ingredients, has been, since it emergence, the major ideological basis of Muslim thought and behaviour. If one understands this non-Quranic ideological configuration under which modern Muslims live, one can grasp the profound import of the prophetic words of the Quran: Shall We treat the submitters like the guilty? What is wrong with you? How do you judge? Do you have anotherÂ Â Â Â Â book that you apply? One that gives you anything you want? (68:35-38) The messenger will say, âMy Lord, my people have deserted this Quran.â (25:30) Â Â Â Of course, the traditionalist theologians and scholars, tied to their traditional âsacrosanctâ methodology, will hotly deny the applicability of these verses to the Muslims. But since the Quran is current, what can the phrase âanother bookâ that âgives you anything you wantâ mean for the Muslims but the Hadith? As to the second verse, it obviously refers to the present rejection of the Quran by all ideological groups of mankind, including the formal Muslims. The term âmy peopleâ used by Prophet Muhammad must mean âall mankindâ since his mission was universal. In spite of the contradictory testimony of historical sources, a general conclusion may be safely drawn that the first division in the early Muslim community between the âorthodoxâ Sunni party and the âheterodoxâ Shiâah party of Ali was both political and religious. The party of Ali resorted to a so-called Ghadir Khum hadith in which the prophet was alleged to have said, âHe of whom I am master, of him Ali is also the master,â in order to bolster up their factionalism when the noble prophet spent his whole life fighting against it! Of course, at this time the hadith had not yet been compiled or institutionalized as a primary source of law, but the great prestige of the prophet had already been misused by the various political and theological factions. It should be well noted that as long as the Quran remained the only primary source of reference for the Muslims, they could reunite and advance on the basis of its teachings, but as soon as they set up other sources of reference to rival the Quran, as happened when they set up the Hadith as the âsecond primaryâ source, the division became irreversible, continuous and permanent. I have sufficiently shown in my little book that the so-called âauthenticâ Hadith possess the characteristics of being sectarian and factional, anti-science, anti-reason, and Continued on page 3 behaviour.

[To be continued in the coming issues] MEDITATION ON A JUGULAR VEIN by Steve A. Johnson Closer to me than my jugular vein? Then He knew. He knew when joy slipped into routine into hatred, Why didn’t He just flick my heart, ever so lightly – a reassurance, a hope filled nudge? But He didn’t, and even hatred slipped away. Then came the tears of pleading, “Please let me feel.” But the answer? Silence. Always the same “please”, the same questions, the same remnants of hope; but the same answer – Silence. The tears stopped. Everyone walks through the desert,” the wise – feigning, saint – feigning Muslim sheikh said. He didn’t understand. It was not the desert I feared. Deserts can have blue sky surrounding the cruel sun, they have shifting sands, days and nights, skittering creatures – life. I don’t fear the desert, only the absence of desert; the absence of feeling – spiritual death. He knew when the prayer was followed by sighs and quiet stares through cold window glass into …onto streets chaotic with twilight traffic. He was there when I played my role – Mr. Muslim lecturing to the lost lonely miserable unbelievers – a paid savior amid the “ma sha’Allah’s” and “Allahu Akbar’s”. Why always the silence inside, placing silent judgment on the different me’s? He felt and knew before I forced my smile, a handshake, a word of praise. So what was He teaching me? What was I to see? What insight? What meaning? He was closer to that the pulsing vein the moment I whispered, “NO”, “NO MORE.” No more. My God is not of ossified rules separating men from women, believers in this from believers in that. My God does not sit sternly denouncing the goodness outside the barbed wire of Islamic law, or condemning love that bursts into music and festivity. He felt the joy in me, in Him when after the “NO” I said “YES” to the mysterious Real beyond theology, beyond hadith, cosmic light and hope years past ritual. He sustained the me that did not leave a truth, but who now embraces The Truth that cannot be enshrined in Arabic. No, it is The Truth that dances on the languages of wordless faith. Closer than my jugular vein? He knew and felt it all. He gave the permission, and shared in the journey. It cannot be wrong or evil because life cannot be wrong or evil. If He is closer to me than me, then it was all His and it was good.

It’s no secret, really - it’s simply Quran. “Yeah,” he’d probably say with a sly smiling twinkle, “Simply Qur’an. Just the Word of God.” Well, you get the point. His platform is indeed constructed entirely on Qur’an, a fact which is gently evident in conversation with him. Unlike so many self-styled “scholars” and ignorant “alims,” his incessant reference to Qur’an is truly spontaneous, uncontrived – and uncluttered by fishy fish stories and fatuous fatwas. Since my “association” with him (it sounds like we’ve been discovered in a love nest with Shaikh Rattle ‘n Roll and Jimmy Swaggert in ISNA HQ and let’s see how long its takes for that to hit the rumor mill!), I have been asked by countless individuals, “Do you know what Rashad Khalifa is all about?” They have heard, they confide in hushed tones, that he is a spy for the Qadiyanis, a Baha’i, a Mason, Jello Biafra’s podiatrist… No, they’ve never actually met him, they confess; no they haven’t actually read his work, but they’ve heard from someone whose second cousin heard from someone that – But Dr. Khalifa remains unfazed by these rumors; in fact, he seems genuinely amused by them. He says that these tales have actually been instructional, that he’s learned most of what he knows about these sects from the “Islamic” tabloids, the National Expirers of the Muslim world, that broadcast them. Yes, I do know what Rashad Khalifa is all about, or at least, I think I’m beginning to; I only wish that they did. All they would have to do to find out is to pick up a Qur’an. “They want to put out God’s light with their mouths, but God insists upon perfecting. His light…” (9:32) God insists.

IF GOD INSISTS: A TRIBUTE TO RASHAD KHALIFA by Virginia Omar KamounehÂ (formerly Karima Omar ) by Virginia Omar KamounehÂ (formerly Karima Omar ) For several years I had thought of him simply as â The Number 19 Man â â you know, that guy in Arizona whose computer research on the Qurâan had smashed so many intellectual walls, freed so many hearts to accept Godâs last revelation. I also thought of him with a good deal of bewilderment. After all, this Rashad Khalifa, this #19 guy, was also reputed â and openly claimed â to deny Prophetic traditions. Even the collections of hadith which I had invested so much money and so many brain cells in amassing and absorbing. Not only the âweekâ hadith (rather a redundancy, really) which my imported role models frowned upon even more than usual, but the good old Sunni staples of Bukhari and Muslim with their lovely bedtime stories of the Mercy for Mankind forcing his enemies to drink camel urine, gouging out eyes with hot mails â in between satisfying 9 wives in a single evening. So this #19 guy had to prefer the Qurâan â the Word of God â to these gratuitously graphic goodies? Gee. Then how did he know how to do all the fun stuff the sunnah teaches us? How did he know which shoe to put on first, which hand to eat with, or what to say before, during and after going to the bathroom? From what I had been taught, man could not only live by bread alone, but he couldnât even make it on a strict Word of God diet â he had to have supplements, other men to do the hard stuff for him â like thinking . So, for quite a while, my perception of him was marked by ambivalence. Given my intellectual/ emotional/ social state at the time, this was probably the best of all emotions â firm indecision. For quite a while, my comment on Dr. Rashad Khalifa was, âI love the work heâs done with Qurâan and may Allah bless him for it but â I cant agree with his views on hadith.â It was a stock response, a mantra which I dutifully chanted when asked my opinion of this man from the Mysterious East of Tucson. For quite a while. But , as the Qurâan says, âYou pass from stage to stageâ (84:19) and I certainly did. To stage to stage , in fact, through thatâs another story altogether.

But, more often than not, it seemed to have degenerated into a Miles Standish situation with the love originally addressed to God being interceded by an (unwilling) intercessor â a Prophet, a spiritual guide, a teacher or somewhat shaky shaikh. No, I never had met a real lover â not of God, anyway. Iâd encountered lovers of His lovers perhaps, or lovers of lovers of His lovers with their wishful arrangements of carefully cultivated hothouse piety, but no direct â dialing devotees.

Yes, inevitable, for frankly, I excepted to find an air of â of paranoia. After all, anyone who had weathered the slings and arrows of controversy that he had over the years was bound to be a little on the jumpy side. So, I anticipated at least asomber, intense man, one who matched the bold face and exclamation points of his writings. I excepted a man who hadnât time to be silly, hadnât strength left to laugh at himself and was too busy opening hate mail to crack a smile.

I found a lover, a true lover of God. A man whose speech, behavior and mannerisms bore witness to the fact that submission to God is indeed a happy state- not the gloomy and grim affair that so many portray it. I found a man with a quick wit, a ready smile, a gentle humility which was fairly radioactive in its trust and reliance on his Creator. On his Creator . Not on his Creatorâs creation, not on the cultural security blanket of knee-jerk rituals, not on the petty shirk of self-righteous rites or Sufic psychobabble but on God Alone. Ironically, in all my years of searching for a magical mystical cure â all, I found it in a man who demystifies Islam, who cuts trough all of the idolatry of what â to â do â to â whom â with â which- hand- when to reveal the safe, sane and sensible Way that we always pretend and seldom portray it to be. A man who seems content with his God- ââ¦ secure and content soul, come back to your Lord, satisfied and satisfying.â (89:27-28), a man satisfied that God had âimposed no hardship on you in observing the religion.â (22:78) Perhaps thatâs why he ruffles the feathers of so many bird- brained Muslims, for he embodies the truth- the simple fact that piety and clinical depression are not synonymous, not even on speaking terms. A subversive truth, indeed. Dr. Khalifa is indeed a curious case. He had gardens of laurels of impressive achievements on which he could easily rest â and not unjustifiably. His translation of the Qurâan is truly inspired, clear, concise â and being scrapped by its translator. Less than 7 years after its publication, he is publishing a revised edition.

I, have since changed from my previous way of doing the Contact Prayers (Salat) to the correct way I learned from the book. I have also introduced it to my immediate family members and friends. From New York Dear Rashad: I pray Allah this brief communication finds you and the other believers at Masjid Tucson in good health and spirit. We in the New York area are excited in anticipation of the forthcoming authorized original Quran that has been out of print for about 1400 years. We support you and we respect you. Thank you for endeavoring on behalf of all of us. From Coimbatore, India Dear Dr. Rashad Khalifa, the Messenger of God: Praise be to God. In the last few issues of M.P. we are reading an entirely new dimension of the Miracle of the Quran -- the structural miracle -- and this is quite apart from the miracle involving the Arabic alphabets. Now, we are wondering what will be the excuse of those who deny the miracle of the Last Testament of God, and what about those who insist that the name of Muhammad (PBUH) consists of 5 Arabic letters (M.P. of Dec 88)! Will not the tribe of Dr. Ernest Hamilton and âDrâ Assad Basool etc. take note of these miracles? What a horrible punishment would God have reserved for these modern Pharaohs. This is only a small sample of this monthâs mail. Thank God for todayâs communications; the message has been delivered to literally millions of people. What did the disbelievers say? Despite my challenge to them in the February issue of M.P. to âGive Me One Good Reason,â the disbelievers cannot come up with a single reason as to why I could not possibly be Godâs messenger!!!Â Where are the âMuslimâ scholars? Why do they not supply their followers with one, just one, reason in support of their stand? The fact is: the truth must win, in accordance with Godâs law (17:81, 21:18). Appendix 2 Godâs Messenger of the Covenant A messenger of God must present proof that he is Godâs messenger. And we have every right to demand such a proof. Every messenger of God is supported by divine signs proving that he is authorized by the Almighty to deliver His messages. Moses threw down his staff and it turned into a serpent by Godâs leave, Jesus healed the leprous and revived the dead by Godâs leave, Salehâs sign was the famous camel, Abraham walked out of the fire, and Muhammadâs miracle was the Quran (29:50-51). The Quran (3:18, 33:7), and the Bible before that (Malachi 3:1-8), have prophesied the advent of a consolidating messenger, Godâs Messenger of the Covenant, whose mission is to purify and unify the messages of all the prophets into one. Henceforth, there is only one religion; Islam (3:19) . It is only befitting that a messenger with such a crucial mission must be supported by the most powerful miracle (74:30-35). While the miracles of previous messengers were limited in time and place, Godâs miracle supporting His Messenger of the Covenant is perpetual, verifiable, and utterly incontrovertible. What is shown above is the abstract of Appendix 2 from the new translation. The Appendix lists Quranic mathematical evidence that Rashad Khalifa is Godâs Messenger of the Covenant. If you want an advance copy of this very important Appendix, we will be glad to send it to you for the cost of copying and mailing ($3.00) [$5.00 outside the USA].

    "content": "May 1989:  , 2 , 3 , 4 Submitters Perspective  World-Wide Recognition of God’s Messenger of the Covenant Must Come -- at the Right Time Thank God for His perfect plan. There is so much work to be done, that a widespread recognition of His messenger, at the wrong time, would actually hinder the mission. First and foremost : There was the purification of the Quran, followed by publishing the pure Arabic text, and its authorized English rendering. If I were recognized by a million people, they simply would have consumed all my time, leaving no time for the important work of translating and publishing God’s Final Testament. As you all know, I enjoy meeting you at the airport, hosting you at Masjid Tucson, and I genuinely enjoy giving you the attention you deserve when you are in Tucson. There is no greater honor than serving and being in the company of the extremely fortunate believers named by Almighty God as “Al-Saabeqoon, Al-Saabeqoon,” who are God’s very special servants and the closest to Him. They are “Al-Muqarraboon.” (see 56:11). I must add here that all of you have been truly sympathetic, compassionate and understanding, and this is my chance to tell you that I did notice, and I have been appreciative. It is a matter of statistics; if there were a million of you at this time, I would have been overwhelmed by a greater number of honored guests who would totally consume the time needed for work. There is so much work to be done. And I expect to devote a few more years to such work. The main work has been completed, ALHAMDU LILLAH. The momentous work of publishing the pure Quran for the first time,* together with its English rendering, has been done. You will have the book in your hands IN SHAA ALLAH within a few weeks. The next project is to print and publish Lisa Spray’s book entitled, “Jesus.” This is a “Christian” country, and the people need to know God’s truth about Jesus. As you know, our first limited printing was exhausted in a couple of months. Those of you who are still waiting for a copy; there is light at the end of the tunnel. You will get your copy IN SHAA ALLAH by December 89. Then comes the English CONCORDANCE OF THE QURAN. This is a big project that will enable anyone to find anything in the Quran; all you need is “one word.” Representatives Around the World Witness God’s perfect plan. He has blessed a few extremely fortunate believers in almost every country and placed them in key positions at central locations. They are the ambassadors of the perfected and purified Islam, and they are doing the God-guided job of helping the believers in their respective areas. For example, in Nigeria, these fortunate ambassadors are placed in Lagos (the capital), Kano (the heart of the Muslim area), Minna (Niger State), Benin City, Funtua (Katsina State), Zara (Kaduna State), Sagamni (Ogun State), Sokoto, and in the far northeast corner of Maiduguri (Borno State). In India, you will find the true believers in Bombay, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Kerala, Madras. You will find them in Egypt, Iran, Lybia, Morocco, Pakistan, Europe, Ghana, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and some places I have never heard of. But not a single Arab. In accordance with 47:38, and 54:43 (read also the 15 verses before 54:43), the Arabs have been dismissed from God’s grace. They will be annihilated in the same way God annihilated ‘Aad, Thamoud, and Pharaoh’s army. By the Arabs I mean those from Arabia-the area bound by the Indian Ocean in the South, the Red Sea on the West, the Persian Gulf and the borders of Iran on the East, and the Southern borders of Turkey in the north. * The pure Quran for the first time. The prophet Muhammad lived forty years without the Quran. From the age of 40 to 53, he received about a third of the Quran. The rest was revealed in Medina, with the last revelation occurring only weeks before his death. The Prophet wrote the Quran with his own hand. But it was written in the chronological order, not in the final format that God intends for the world. When ‘Uthman appointed a committe to copy the Quran and put it in the right sequence, they committed the great blasphemy of adding 2 false verses (see past issues of M.P.). The pure Quran never existed before now. Submitters Perspective World-Wide Recognition of God’s Messenger of the Covenant Must Come -- at the Right Time Thank God for His perfect plan.

The pure Quran never existed before now. * The pure Quran for the first time. The prophet Muhammad lived forty years without the Quran. From the age of 40 to 53, he received about a third of the Quran. The rest was revealed in Medina, with the last revelation occurring only weeks before his death. The Prophet wrote the Quran with his own hand. But it was written in the chronological order, not in the final format that God intends for the world.

God Defends the Believers [22:38]: Vicious Attack Against Ahl-Al-Bait Refuted by Godâs Truth I just received a book entitled âAl-Khulafaaâ Al-Rashedoon,â by Abdul-Wahhab Al-Najjar (Dar Al-Kutub Al-âElmeyyah, Beirut). On  , the author assaults the truth, and wages a vicious war on the memory of Ali Ibn Abi Taaleb and his family, the Prophetâs family. In incredible hatred towards Ali and his family, this author writes: âAli and his family considered the Khelaafah their inherited right. They were so extremely greedy for power, that they sacrificed their own lives and the lives of their children, and subjected their women to humiliation and captivity, only because they wanted the throne. The more they lost lives and dignity, the more they became even more greedy. Their greed for power was not curbed by all the killing of their family members, all the mutilation, persecution, and burning....!!â Here Is the Truth It is Godâs will to proclaim the truth to the world, through His Mathematical Miracle of the Quran.

For we know now that Ali and his family sacrificed their lives not for power--never--but for the sake of God and His Quran. They wanted to correct the blasphemy committed by âUthmanâs scribes who added two false verses to the Quran (see M.P. Jan 89). Ali and his family did not care at all about power, and the proof is evident from the fact that Ali was not the first Khalifa. He gave it willingly to Abu Bakr. Ali could have been the Khalifa if he only uttered the words: âI want to be the Khalifa.â Even after Abu Bakrâs death, he did not want the Khelaafah; he willingly gave it to Omar. Then he gave it to âUthman. Ali did not want to be a Khalifa. Only when the committee of scribes who were appointed by â'Uthman committed that great blasphemy of adding verses 9:128-129 to the Quran, only then, Ali accepted the Khelaafah. And only to restore the Quran. Because Ali was not power-conscious, power-hungry, âAmr Ibn Al-âAas and the Umayyads tricked him into the infamous âArbitration Treatyâ (Al-Tahkeem).

If the author of that book had any brain, he would have read his own writings on  of his own book. On  , he says: âWhen the Arbitration was written, Ali was described as âAmeer Al-Muâmineen.â But âAmr Ibn Al-âAas protested that Ali was not the Umayyads Ameer, and demanded that Ali must be referred to as Ali Ibn Abee Taaleb, period. Al-Ahnaf Ibn Qais urged Ali not to agree with Ibn Al-âAas, but Ali went along with the change.â Obviously, Ali, who was in fact Ameer Al-Muâmineen, could have forced the issue and insisted on his rightful title. But he did not care about power. This glaring contradiction should have taught the author that Ali did not care about power at all. Thus, God wills to proclaim the truth. We know now from Appendix 24 of the new translation of the Quran, being distributed by Masjid Tucson, that Ali, Hussein, and the whole family of the Prophet sacrificed their lives for no reason other than restoring the Quran to its pristine purity.
