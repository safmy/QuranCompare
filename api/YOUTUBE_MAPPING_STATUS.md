# YouTube Mapping Status and Issues

## Current State

The YouTube mapping for RashadAllMedia content has been partially fixed, but there are fundamental limitations due to sparse data coverage.

### Issue Summary

1. **Sparse Mapping Coverage**: The `youtube_search_results_updated.json` file only contains mappings for 141 out of 2227 text segments (6.3% coverage).

2. **Incorrect Video Assignment**: When searching for content that doesn't have a direct mapping, the system finds the closest preceding mapped video, which can be quite far away (19+ indices in some cases).

3. **Example Case**: 
   - Content about "age of 40" at timestamp (46:15) is at index 2172
   - No direct mapping exists for index 2172
   - System falls back to index 2153 which maps to "Introduction to Blue Quran"
   - This is incorrect - the content is from a different video

### What Has Been Fixed

1. **Correct Index-Based Lookup**: Changed from line-based to array index-based lookup to match the actual structure of RashadAllMedia.json

2. **Warning System**: Added warnings when mappings are approximate (distance > 10 indices)

3. **Proper Timestamp Extraction**: The system correctly extracts and adds timestamps to YouTube links

### What Is Still Needed

To fully fix this issue, one of the following solutions is required:

1. **Complete Mapping File**: Create a comprehensive `youtube_search_results_updated.json` that maps all 2227 text segments to their corresponding videos.

2. **Video Boundary Detection**: Implement logic to detect when a new video/sermon starts in the RashadAllMedia texts (as mentioned by the user: "the video is always before the text but after any new timeline from another sermon").

3. **Alternative Data Source**: If the Discord bot has access to a more complete mapping, that data source should be used.

### Current Workaround

The system now:
- Finds the closest preceding video mapping
- Adds the correct timestamp from the content
- Displays a warning when the mapping distance is large
- Still provides a YouTube link (though it may be to the wrong video)

### Recommendation

The best solution would be to obtain or create a complete mapping file that accurately maps each text segment in RashadAllMedia.json to its corresponding YouTube video. This would ensure users always get the correct video link when searching.
