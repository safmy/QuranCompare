It never calls the Prophet’s community “the Arabs”; it only calls the scripture “an Arabic Qur’an” and it calls the wandering tribes “the aʿrāb”.\n\n1. Where the Qur’an says ʿarabī\nArabic phrase    Verse    Rashad Khalifa’s rendering\nقُرۡءَٰنًا عَرَبِيًّا    12 : 2    “an Arabic Qur’an so that you may understand” \nQuran.com\nبِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِيٍّ مُّبِينٍ    26 : 195    “in a clear Arabic tongue” \nQuran.com\nلِسَانٌ عَرَبِيٌّ مُبِينٌ    16 : 103    “this is an eloquent Arabic tongue” \nQuran.com\n\nAll eleven occurrences of the root in this form (12 : 2; 13; 16 : 103; 20 : 113; 26 : 195; 39 : 28; 41 : 3, 44; 42 : 7; 43 : 3; 46 : 12) describe the medium of the message, never a people.\n\nMorphology – faʿīl pattern, normal adjective; no hamza.\n\n2. Where the Qur’an says al-aʿrāb\nArabic word    Verse    Rashad Khalifa’s rendering\nٱلْأَعْرَابُ أَشَدُّ كُفۡرًا وَنِفَاقًا    9 : 97    “The Nomads are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy…” \nQuran.com\nقَالَتِ ٱلْأَعْرَابُ آمَنَّا    49 : 14    “Some of the nomadic Arabs say, ‘We believe.’ …” \nQuran.com\nٱلْأَعْرَابَ ٱلَّذِينَ حَوْلَكُم    9 : 101    “the Nomads around you…” (context follows 9 : 97)\n\nTen occurrences (9 : 97-99, 101, 120; 33 : 20; 48 : 11, 16; 49 : 14) all talk about people who live outside the settled towns – sometimes hostile, sometimes sincere (9 : 99).\n\nMorphology – hamza + afʿāl plural gives aʿrāb, traditionally glossed “Bedouins”. Classical lexicons contrast:\n\nʿarab = sedentary eloquent Arabs; aʿrāb = nomads of the desert.\n\n3. What the distinction means\nLanguage vs. lifestyle. The scripture is praised for its Arabic clarity; the aʿrāb are criticised or praised according to conduct, never language.\n\nNo racial label. The Qur’an does not use al-ʿarab for an ethnic bloc. Ethnic nationalism comes from later literature, not from the Quranic text.\n\nWhy the harsh tone? Desert tribes on Medina’s frontier controlled trade routes and could betray or support the believers. Verses 9 and 48 spell out that tension bluntly – some nomads were reliable allies, many were not. The wording is intentionally direct.\n\n4. Bottom line for readers of the Final Testament\nWord in Arabic    How Rashad Khalifa translates it    What it refers to\nعَرَبِي/عَرَبِيًّا    “Arabic”    The language/tongue of the Qur’an\nٱلْأَعْرَاب    “the Nomads”    Desert-dwelling tribes, Bedouins\n\nSo whenever you read “Arabic” in the Final Testament you are seeing ʿarabī, and whenever you read “Nomads” you are seeing al-aʿrāb – two different words with two very different targets.",
