# Audio Hosting Solution for QuranCompare

## Current Implementation
The app currently uses the Al-Quran Cloud CDN for audio files. I've implemented rate limiting protection and retry logic to handle CDN limitations, but for optimal performance, you may want to host audio files yourself.

## Improved Audio Features
✅ **Rate limiting protection** - 1 second minimum between plays
✅ **Automatic retry** - Up to 3 retries with exponential backoff  
✅ **Lower bitrate** - Using 64kbps to reduce bandwidth
✅ **Better error handling** - Clear feedback on failures
✅ **Global audio manager** - Prevents multiple simultaneous plays

## Optional: Self-Hosting Audio Files

If you want to completely eliminate rate limiting, here's how to host audio files yourself:

### 1. Download Audio Files
```bash
# Create audio directory
mkdir -p public/audio/quran

# Download all verses (this will take time and bandwidth)
for i in {1..6236}; do
  curl -o "public/audio/quran/${i}.mp3" \
    "https://cdn.islamic.network/quran/audio/64/ar.alafasy/${i}.mp3"
  sleep 0.1  # Be respectful to the CDN
done
```

### 2. Update verseMapping.js
```javascript
export const getVerseAudioUrl = (reference, bitrate = 64) => {
  const verseNumber = getAbsoluteVerseNumber(reference);
  if (!verseNumber) return null;
  
  // Use local files instead of CDN
  return `/audio/quran/${verseNumber}.mp3`;
};
```

### 3. Considerations
- **Storage**: ~500MB for all verses at 64kbps
- **Build time**: Will increase significantly 
- **Deployment**: Make sure your hosting supports the file size
- **CDN**: Consider using a CDN for the audio files

### 4. Alternative: GitHub Releases
Upload audio files to GitHub releases and point to those URLs:
```javascript
const AUDIO_BASE = 'https://github.com/safmy/QuranCompare/releases/download/audio-v1.0';
return `${AUDIO_BASE}/${verseNumber}.mp3`;
```

## Current Status
The implemented solution should handle most rate limiting issues. Users will see:
- Loading indicators
- Retry counters (1⏳, 2⏳, 3⏳)
- Error states (❌) for persistent failures
- Rate limiting between plays (minimum 1 second)

This should resolve the memorization workflow issues without requiring self-hosting.
