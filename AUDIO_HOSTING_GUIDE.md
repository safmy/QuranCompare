# Audio Hosting Solution for QuranCompare

## Current Implementation - Multi-CDN Fallback System
The app now uses **4 different audio CDN providers** with automatic fallback to ensure reliable audio playback:

1. **Al-Quran Cloud** (Primary) - `cdn.islamic.network`
2. **EveryAyah.com** (Fallback 1) - `everyayah.com`  
3. **Quran.com CDN** (Fallback 2) - `audio.qurancdn.com`
4. **Archive.org** (Fallback 3) - `archive.org`

## Audio Features
✅ **Multi-CDN fallback** - Automatically tries 4 different sources
✅ **Rate limiting protection** - 1 second minimum between plays
✅ **Smart retry logic** - Tries different providers before retrying same source  
✅ **Lower bitrate** - Using 64kbps to reduce bandwidth
✅ **Better error handling** - Shows which source is being tried
✅ **Global audio manager** - Prevents multiple simultaneous plays

## Optional: Self-Hosting Audio Files

If you want to completely eliminate rate limiting, here's how to host audio files yourself:

### 1. Download Audio Files
```bash
# Create audio directory
mkdir -p public/audio/quran

# Download all verses (this will take time and bandwidth)
for i in {1..6236}; do
  curl -o "public/audio/quran/${i}.mp3" \
    "https://cdn.islamic.network/quran/audio/64/ar.alafasy/${i}.mp3"
  sleep 0.1  # Be respectful to the CDN
done
```

### 2. Update verseMapping.js
```javascript
export const getVerseAudioUrl = (reference, bitrate = 64) => {
  const verseNumber = getAbsoluteVerseNumber(reference);
  if (!verseNumber) return null;
  
  // Use local files instead of CDN
  return `/audio/quran/${verseNumber}.mp3`;
};
```

### 3. Considerations
- **Storage**: ~500MB for all verses at 64kbps
- **Build time**: Will increase significantly 
- **Deployment**: Make sure your hosting supports the file size
- **CDN**: Consider using a CDN for the audio files

### 4. Alternative: GitHub Releases
Upload audio files to GitHub releases and point to those URLs:
```javascript
const AUDIO_BASE = 'https://github.com/safmy/QuranCompare/releases/download/audio-v1.0';
return `${AUDIO_BASE}/${verseNumber}.mp3`;
```

## Current Status
The implemented solution should handle most rate limiting issues. Users will see:
- Loading indicators
- Retry counters (1⏳, 2⏳, 3⏳)
- Error states (❌) for persistent failures
- Rate limiting between plays (minimum 1 second)

This should resolve the memorization workflow issues without requiring self-hosting.
