# Implementation Summary

## 1. Prayer Times - Daylight Saving Time Fix ✅

### Changes Made:
- **File**: `/src/components/PrayerTimes.jsx`
- **Fix**: Updated the `convertToLocalTime` function to properly handle timezone conversions and DST
- **Key Change**: Now creates UTC date objects and converts them to the target timezone, which automatically handles DST transitions

### Technical Details:
```javascript
// Before: Created local date and set hours directly (DST issues)
const prayerDate = new Date(date);
prayerDate.setHours(hours, minutes, 0, 0);

// After: Creates UTC date and converts to timezone (handles DST correctly)
const utcDate = new Date(Date.UTC(
  date.getFullYear(),
  date.getMonth(),
  date.getDate(),
  hours,
  minutes,
  0,
  0
));
```

### Additional Improvements:
- Added timezone detection for manual city searches using the free timeapi.io service
- This ensures accurate prayer times for any location worldwide

## 2. Appendices PDF Download ⚠️ Partially Complete

### What Was Done:
1. Created download scripts to fetch appendices PDFs
2. Set up the directory structure: `/public/appendices/`
3. Updated the Appendices component to support local PDF hosting
4. Added UI elements for PDF viewing/downloading when available

### Issue Encountered:
- Direct PDF downloads are not available from the source websites
- All attempted URLs either return 404 errors or HTML pages instead of PDFs

### Current Status:
- The infrastructure is ready for PDF hosting
- The component checks for local PDFs and displays download buttons when available
- Falls back to online links when PDFs are not present

### To Complete This Feature:
1. Obtain PDF files manually from:
   - https://www.wikisubmission.org/appendices
   - https://masjidtucson.org/publications/
   
2. Place PDFs in `/public/appendices/`:
   - `appendices_complete.pdf` for the full collection
   - `appendix_01.pdf`, `appendix_02.pdf`, etc. for individual files

3. Use the provided script: `/scripts/setup_appendices_pdfs.sh`

## 3. Local PDF Hosting ✅

### Implementation:
- PDFs are served from the `/public/appendices/` directory
- The Appendices component automatically detects available PDFs
- Provides both "View" and "Download" options when PDFs are present
- Gracefully falls back to online links when PDFs are not available

### Files Modified:
1. `/src/components/Appendices.jsx` - Added PDF detection and download functionality
2. `/src/components/Appendices.css` - Added styles for PDF download buttons
3. `/public/appendices/metadata.json` - Contains appendices metadata

### Usage:
Once PDFs are added to `/public/appendices/`, users will see:
- A "View All Appendices (PDF)" button to open the complete PDF
- A "Download PDF" button to save the file locally
- Individual appendix links continue to work as before

## Next Steps

1. **Obtain Appendices PDFs**: Contact the maintainers or download from the source websites
2. **Test Prayer Times**: Verify the DST fix works correctly in different timezones
3. **Deploy Changes**: Push the updated code to production

## Technical Notes

- The prayer times calculation now properly handles:
  - Daylight Saving Time transitions
  - Different timezone formats
  - Location-based timezone detection
  
- The PDF hosting system is flexible and can accommodate:
  - A single complete PDF
  - Individual appendix PDFs
  - Both simultaneously

- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
